## Hi there! 

Thank you for finding my blog. I write about everyday things in life, my thoughts, my essays & poetry, technology & career in the IT industry, for now (who knows what I will be interested in later on).

I'm Horace. I like games, cooking, pixel arts, harmonica, and fediverse.

I do data engineering for a living in Singapore (A tiny and humid island city famous for its rediculous housing prices and authoritarian government), which means I cook raw data and make them edible pieces for data scientists and algorithm engineers.

I am enthusiastic about technology and open & free software that empowers people who are less heard. The revolutionary idea of taking back control of your own online life advocated by Fediverse fascinated me and I became a dedicated user of mastodon and later other Fediverse apps. You can find Fediverse instances on the *Link* page that I host and maybe join yourself.

I LOVE games. I love

- *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* and its derivative card game *Gwent: the Witcher Card Game*
- *Crusader Kings*, *Europa Universalis*, *Victoria* of Paradox Interactive
- *Bloodborne*
- *Horizon: Forbidden West*
- *Slay the Spire* (I'm making a mod for it now)
