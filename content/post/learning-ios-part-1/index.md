## Why

Metatext is actually recommended by a friend of mine. It has been an simple and elegant little app on my phone ever since I joined the Fediverse. I feel saddened when the original author announced that he'll stop developing the app due to health issues, thus I emailed him about helping to maintain the project but to this day there's no reply yet. The original git repository was archived on Dec, 2022 and the last post from Justin's account was this January.

Although app development is an alien field for me, I still wish to continue develop and maintain Metatext and some day probably compelement the missing features of mastodon 4 (editing a post and following a hashtag, for example).

I made a [post](https://m.otter.homes/@horaceyoung/110449616454824240) on mastodon to ask if fellow ios developers have any recommendations about the intro material for swift and received some good responses. In this blog and the following I'll record the learning journey of mine. Stay tuned!
